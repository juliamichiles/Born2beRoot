## To do:

- [x] READEME is missing 'Project description' section
- [x] Remove questions from README file
- [ ] At school, check if cron is properly set and if the script is being printed at startup
- [ ] Test sleep.sh script and ad this to crontab '@reboot /root/sleep.sh'
- [ ] Possibly remove the 10 min thing from chrontab
- [ ] Check YouTube video on how to get the signature and copy the VM for eval 

## Questions:

- Should have the 42 header?
- In the line bellow should it be my user or full 42 email?
- Should 'Description' and 'Project Description' be the same section?
